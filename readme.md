# How to execute Random Scrape on Wikipedia Articles with Python

In this project I'm going to create a random web scraper in Python that will scrape Wikipedia pages.

The scraper will go to a Wikipedia page, scrape the title, and follow a random link to the next Wikipedia page. I think it will be fun to see what random Wikipedia pages this scraper will visit!

## Installed libraries:
```python
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
